## 3. EDA: Stripe Connect Project
Stripe Connect is a product that allows platform businesses to pay out money to other businesses all over the world. In this project, you will analyze the payout behavior of Stripe platforms. A platform is a Stripe user that enables other businesses to process payments with Stripe.
Data: The dataset `payouts.csv` has daily payout amounts (in cents) from platforms to recipients. Both platforms and recipients are represented by a merchant id. In the dataset, the platform merchant is specified by `platform_id` and the recipient is specified by `recipient_id`. The dataset `countries.csv` maps merchants to countries and the dataset `industries.csv` maps merchants to industries.
### Questions to answer with the data:
- Using the data provided, please provide an estimate for the amount of money we should expect to be paid out to each country on Jan. 1, 2019 (the day after the last day in the dataset).
- Assume that one year from the end of the dataset, we will have 15 platforms from the Education industry, 5 from Hotels, Restaurants & Leisure and 40 from Food & Beverage. How much total payout volume do you expect to see on a typical day in 2019, from these three industries?
- Given this data, what metrics would you define and track in order to help product and business teams understand the progress and behavior of Stripe Connect?
